# CarDetective
A system that can track and extract license plate information from images of vehicles and provide the relevant vehicle details by matching the extracted license plate information with a pre-defined dataset.

**Note: Specifically for the `DoTesseract` Java class in this project, certain paths may be relative and may need to be tailored to your local environment or project setup. Please review and modify the paths within the `DoTesseract` class as necessary to match your PC-specific configuration.**
